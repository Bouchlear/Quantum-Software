# Quantum-Software
The collection of algorithms, programming languages, and tools developed to design, simulate, and execute quantum computations, as well as analyze and interpret the results obtained from quantum hardware devices.
There is several Quantum software, frameworks based on qubits types implementation including (Superconducting, Neural Atoms, Photonic device, and Ions Trapped...)
Here are some of the notable quantum software frameworks:
## 1-  Qiskit: 
It is an open-source software development kit (SDK) developed by IBM. It is designed to facilitate quantum programming and research by providing tools for creating, simulating, and executing quantum circuits and algorithms. Qiskit supports various quantum backends, and it is based on a superconducting qubits device. we can get access to this framework on [IBM Quantum Lab](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/lab) IBM Quantum provides an explained [documentation](https://qiskit.org/documentation/) and a [qiskit textbook](https://qiskit.org/learn/) open for everyone to start learning Quantum Computing and quantum programming.

## 2- Cirq:
Cirq is an open-source quantum computing framework developed by Google. It Python software library and tailored for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices and allows researchers and developers to create, manipulate, simulate quantum circuits, and then run them on quantum computers and quantum simulators based on Superconducting Qubits. You can explore and [start programming with Cirq](https://quantumai.google/software).

## 3- Microsoft Quantum Development Kit (QDK): 
it is a quantum programming platform developed by Microsoft. It includes Q#, a domain-specific language designed for quantum computing, enabling researchers and developers to write quantum algorithms and run them on quantum simulators and quantum hardware.
you can learn the tools and documentation [here](https://quantum.microsoft.com/) and get started with [Azure Quantum](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/quantum/).

## 4- Xanadu's PennyLane: 
PennyLane is an open-source software library developed by Xanadu that focuses on quantum machine learning and hybrid quantum-classical computing. It integrates quantum hardware and simulators with popular machine-learning libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch. Explore [Pennylane](https://pennylane.ai/); an amazing source of learning and programing.

## 5- Bloquade:
Bloqadeâ„¢ is Software Development Kit developed by QuEra, it facilitates benchmarking and algorithmic design, integrating the fundamental advantages of neutral-atom arrays for quantum computing. With features such as flexible processor geometry, multi-qubit connectivity, and analog operation modes, it is both versatile and potent. Once the algorithm is prepared, [Bloqade](https://www.quera.com/bloqade) can be conveniently used to deploy it for execution on a quantum computer. you can find more information about it in this [education repository](https://github.com/QuEraComputing/quera-education/).

## 6- Ocean SDK: 
The [Ocean Software Development Ki](https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/en/stable/) (SDK) is developed by D-Wave Systems. It provides tools and libraries for quantum annealing, a type of quantum computing suitable for optimization problems.
